# Model card — OpenUI TwoTower / grammar-diffusion

Canonical card for checkpoints produced by this repo. Agents **must update
this file whenever a new checkpoint is created or promoted** (full train,
remote train, bootstrap demo, or matrix champion intended for reuse), then
mirror a short summary into [`README.md`](../README.md) → “Model card (summary)”.

Storage: durable full-run weights live in
[`hf://buckets/TKendrick/OpenUI`](https://huggingface.co/buckets/TKendrick/OpenUI)
(`checkpoints/<run_id>/`). Local/git fixture demo:
`fixtures/checkpoints/playground_demo/`.

## Current checkpoint roster

| Role | Run id | Kind | Location | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Playground demo | `playground_demo` | Fixture wiring | `fixtures/checkpoints/playground_demo/last.pt` (git) | Demo only — **not** a ship claim |
| Matrix honest champion (scratch) | `qx_e53_*` (V6 E53 family) | CPU scratch matrix clear | Primarily `outputs/runs/` (+ docs matrix JSON) | Honest `--ship-gates` on limited `rico_held` n; **not** production HF ship |
| Production HF ship | — | — | `hf://buckets/TKendrick/OpenUI/checkpoints/<run_id>/` | **None registered yet** — fill this row after the first full HF sync |

Update the table in place when a checkpoint is written or superseded. Keep
invalidated / superseded rows in **Checkpoint history** below.

## Intended use

- Generate **placeholder OpenUI** layout programs (`openuiLibrary` syntax) from
  natural-language prompts, optionally conditioned on DESIGN.md.
- Train / eval harness research for TwoTower masked diffusion and
  grammar-diffusion codecs with honest multi-suite ship gates.

**Not intended:** production UI without human review; treating fixture-demo or
scratch-matrix clears as production readiness; silent gold-placeholder channels.

---

## Architecture (serving defaults)

| Piece | Default / notes |
| --- | --- |
| Model | TwoTower (context tower + MaskGIT-style denoiser); optional `grammar_diffusion` |
| Context | HF frozen backbone (`HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M`) for full ship track; scratch for matrix/CI demos |
| Output tokenizer | Compositional `OpenUITokenizer` (default) or V5 lexer (`DSLNativeTokenizer`) |
| Decode | Grammar-constrained LTR / MaskGIT + repair levers (see design docs) |
| Eval gates | Multi-suite `--ship-gates` (parse, structural, `placeholder_fidelity`, reward) |

---

## How to load

```bash
# Fixture demo (annotate playground)
python -m scripts.serve_playground
# → fixtures/checkpoints/playground_demo/last.pt

# Full-run checkpoint from the OpenUI bucket (after sync)
hf buckets sync \
  hf://buckets/TKendrick/OpenUI/checkpoints/<run_id> \
  ./outputs/runs/<run_id>/checkpoints

python -m scripts.evaluate_model \
  --test-dir outputs/test_data/v1 \
  --run-id <run_id> \
  --ship-gates
```

Sidecars required next to `*.pt`: `.tokenizer.json`, `.meta.json`
(optional `.context.tokenizer.json`).

## Training data

| Split | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Train | `outputs/train_data/v1` (all sources + quality synth) for ship | Fixture upsample = demo only |
| Eval | `outputs/test_data/v1` suites: smoke, held_out, adversarial, ood, `rico_held` | Ship claims need full `rico_held` (1500) when asserted |

Leakage: structural fingerprints + train/test isolation
([adversarial-review.md](design/adversarial-review.md)).

---

## Evaluation (fill per checkpoint)

| Suite | n | parse | fidelity | struct | reward | Pass? |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| smoke | | | | | | |
| held_out | | | | | | |
| adversarial | | | | | | |
| ood | | | | | | |
| rico_held | | | | | | |

Record device, steps, context backend, honesty mode (`honest_slot_contract`),
and whether gates used `--ship-gates`. Link
`docs/design/*-results.json` / run `gates.json` when available.

**Known honest fixture clears (not production):** V6 E50/E53/E55 on CPU scratch
with limited `rico_held` n — see
[quality-experiment-matrix.md](design/quality-experiment-matrix.md).

---

## Limitations & honesty

- Smoke parse alone is a canary, not generalization.
- Soft `placeholder_validity` is diagnostic; ship on `placeholder_fidelity`.
- Inventory must come from the user-visible prompt / DESIGN.md under
  `honest_slot_contract=True` (no silent `gold.placeholders`).
- Scratch + short steps ≠ HF + full `rico_held` production claim.

## Checkpoint history

| Date (UTC) | Run id | Bucket / path | Metric headline | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (seed) | `playground_demo` | `fixtures/checkpoints/playground_demo/` | wiring demo | Committed fixture; regenerate via `bootstrap_playground` |

Append a row for every new or replaced checkpoint. Do not delete history.

---

## Agent checklist (after each checkpoint)

1. Sync durable weights (HF bucket for full runs) —
   [checkpoint-bucket.md](design/checkpoint-bucket.md).
2. Update **Current checkpoint roster** + **Evaluation** + **Checkpoint history**
   in this file.
3. Refresh the **Model card (summary)** section in [`README.md`](../README.md)
   (keep it short; link here for detail).
4. Point measured-results / matrix docs at the new run id when relevant.
5. Commit docs with the checkpoint-producing change.
