# Quality experiment matrix — TwoTower OpenUI

> Agentic workers: implement levers below, then run `python -m scripts.run_quality_matrix`.

**Goal:** Clear honest `--ship-gates` by attacking fidelity=0 / parse≈0 with every approach from the quality brief.

**Architecture:** Each row is an isolatable lever (plus a stacked `combo` run). All runs use scratch context on CPU by default; HF is optional when cached.

**Tech stack:** TwoTower, OpenUI grammar, ship_gates, preference composite reward.

## Failure baseline (`twotower_v1_ship`)

| Suite | parse | fidelity | struct | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| smoke | 1.0 | **0.0** | 0.68 | fail fidelity |
| held_out | **0.0** | 0.0 | 0.48 | fail parse |
| adversarial | **0.0** | 0.0 | 0.45 | fail parse |
| ood | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.45 | pass |
| rico_held | **0.0** | ~0 | 0.17 | fail |

## Matrix

| ID | Approach | Primary lever | Expected gate delta | Run id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E0 | Baseline ship recipe | `v1` train, LTR primary, no repair | establish current | `qx_e0_baseline` |
| E1 | Constrained decode | `grammar_ltr_repair=true` | ↑ held_out/adv parse | `qx_e1_repair` |
| E2 | Curriculum data | stages A→B→C sampling | ↑ rico struct / parse | `qx_e2_curriculum` |
| E3 | Fidelity aux loss | `fidelity_loss_weight>0` | ↑ smoke/held fidelity | `qx_e3_fidelity` |
| E4 | Schema conditioning | `schema_in_context=true` | ↑ component recall / parse | `qx_e4_schema` |
| E5 | Preference + best-of-N | valid-worse pairs + `best_of_n=4` | ↑ reward / parse | `qx_e5_pref_bon` |
| E6 | Retrieval skeletons | `retrieval_k=1` | ↑ rico parse/struct | `qx_e6_retrieve` |
| E7 | Capacity upgrade | larger d_model / layers / gen_len | ↑ rico struct | `qx_e7_capacity` |
| E8 | Combo (all) | E1–E7 stacked | best chance at ship | `qx_e8_combo` |

## Success criteria (honest gates)

Same policy as `docs/design/adversarial-review.md`. Matrix may evaluate `rico_held` with `--rico-limit` for CPU time; full 1500 is the ship claim.

## Commands

```bash
# Build curriculum corpus (once)
python -m scripts.build_train_data --source all --version v1_curriculum \
  --synthesizer quality --curriculum

# Run full matrix (scratch CPU). Use --no-design-md-context when seeding from
# the fixture-demo ship checkpoint (it was trained without DESIGN.md in context).
python -m scripts.run_quality_matrix \
  --device cpu --context-backend scratch --steps 800 \
  --no-design-md-context \
  --seed-checkpoint outputs/runs/twotower_v1_ship/checkpoints/last.pt

# Single experiment
python -m scripts.run_quality_matrix --only E1,E7 --steps 800 --no-design-md-context \
  --seed-checkpoint outputs/runs/twotower_v1_ship/checkpoints/last.pt
```

## Measured results (CPU, 800 steps, scratch, no DESIGN.md in context)

See [quality-matrix-results.json](quality-matrix-results.json). Headline deltas vs ship memorizer:

| ID | Smoke parse | Adv parse | RICO parse | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SHIP | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | fidelity 0 everywhere |
| E1 repair | **1.0** | **0.25** | 0.0 | adversarial gate met; fidelity still 0 |
| E2 curriculum | 0.0 | **0.75** | 0.0 | best stress parse |
| E4 schema | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.22 | mild RICO lift |
| E7 capacity | 0.0 | 0.0 | **0.88** | best RICO; struct 0.37 |
| E8 combo | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | underfit at 800 steps on stacked levers |

**None clear honest `--ship-gates`.** Next: longer HF+DESIGN.md train (E0/E8), fidelity-targeted objectives, and keep E1 repair on for quality evals.
